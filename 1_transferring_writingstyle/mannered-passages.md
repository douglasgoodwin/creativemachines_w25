# Mannered Writing Examples

## 1. From Newton's Opticks (Natural Philosophy)
When I made the foregoing Observations, I design'd to repeat them with more care and exactness, and to make some new ones for determining the manner how the Rays of Light are bent in their passage by Bodies, for making the Fringes of Colours with the dark lines between them. And after I had done this, I design'd to have made more Observations for determining the manner how the Rays of Light are reflected, refracted and inflected by Bodies for completing my Theory of Light and Colours. But I was then interrupted, and cannot now think of taking these things into further consideration.

## 2. From Virginia Woolf's "To the Lighthouse" (Literary Fiction)
For now she need not think about anybody. She could be herself, by herself. And that was what now she often felt the need ofâ€”to think; well, not even to think. To be silent; to be alone. All the being and the doing, expansive, glittering, vocal, evaporated; and one shrunk, with a sense of solemnity, to being oneself, a wedge-shaped core of darkness, something invisible to others. Although she continued to knit, and sat upright, it was thus that she felt herself; and this self having shed its attachments was free for the strangest adventures.

## 3. From Henry James's "The Portrait of a Lady" (Literary Fiction)
Under certain circumstances there are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea, and the circumstances that had now been gathered together in the old room at Gardencourt might have figured, to anyone acquainted with them, as eligible items in such a catalogue. From five o'clock to eight is on certain occasions a little eternity; but on such an occasion as this the interval could be only an eternity of pleasure. The persons concerned in it were taking their pleasure quietly, and they were not of the sex which is supposed to furnish the regular votaries of the ceremony I have mentioned.

## 4. From Thomas Browne's "Hydriotaphia" (Philosophical Meditation)
Time which antiquates antiquities, and hath an art to make dust of all things, hath yet spared these minor monuments. In vain we hope to be known by open and visible conservatories, when to be unknown was the means of their preservation, and to have been overlooked the highest recompense of things worthy to have lasted. What virtue yet sleeps in this terra damnata and aged cinders, were petty magic to experiment; these crumbling relics and long-fired particles superannuate such expectations.

## 5. From John Milton's "Areopagitica" (Political Philosophy)
For books are not absolutely dead things, but do contain a potency of life in them to be as active as that soul was whose progeny they are; nay, they do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy and extraction of that living intellect that bred them. I know they are as lively, and as vigorously productive, as those fabulous dragon's teeth; and being sown up and down, may chance to spring up armed men. And yet, on the other hand, unless wariness be used, as good almost kill a man as kill a good book: who kills a man kills a reasonable creature, God's image; but he who destroys a good book, kills reason itself.
