# Plain Writing Examples

## 1. From Joan Didion's "The Year of Magical Thinking" (Memoir)
Life changes fast. Life changes in the instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends. The question of self-pity. These were the first words I wrote after it happened. The notes still exist, on a yellow legal pad, the first two pages in my handwriting, the rest typed. For a long time I wrote nothing else. Life changes in the instant. The ordinary instant. At the time, I recognized none of this. The power of grief to derange the mind has been exhaustively noted.

## 2. From George Orwell's "Politics and the English Language" (Essay)
A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions. What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in.

## 3. From Ernest Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea" (Fiction)
He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week.

## 4. From E.B. White's "Elements of Style" (Writing Guide)
Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all sentences short, or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word tell. Many expressions in common use violate this principle. Take the expression "the question as to whether." The "question as to" is simply extra words, which should be omitted.

## 5. From Annie Dillard's "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek" (Nature Writing)
Fish gotta swim and birds gotta fly; insects, it seems, gotta do one horrible thing after another. I never ask why of a vulture or shark, but I ask why of almost every insect I see. More than one insect-sharp fellow has told me that insects have no pain threshold above which they perceive pain. This is a miserable idea, if not a miserable fact. They don't suffer, goes the thinking, so it's not so bad when they attack each other, or when a wasp paralyzes a grasshopper and a spider eats a fly.
