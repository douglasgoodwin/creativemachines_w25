**Creative Machines**: Art and Technology in the Digital Age  

---

### *This is the course that AI wants for you*
This course delves into the concept of the **“creative machine”**, defined as a system, process, or apparatus that fosters creativity, and examines how **artificial intelligence (AI)** enhances such systems. Students will engage with foundational media theory texts, such as Walter Benjamin's *The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction* and Marshall McLuhan and Quentin Fiore's *The Medium is the Massage*, while reinterpreting these works through the lens of 21st-century technology and culture.  

Through hands-on projects utilizing tools like **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Stable Diffusion**, students will reimagine the ideas of Benjamin and McLuhan for contemporary audiences, addressing the UCLA and Claremont communities. The course culminates in the design and construction of personalized creative machines that demonstrate critical engagement with technology, art, and creativity in modern life.

---

### **Course Objectives**  
By the end of the course, students will be able to:  
- Assess how AI influences and reshapes creative practices.  
- Critically evaluate canonical works in media theory from a digital perspective.  
- Use AI tools (e.g., LLMs, Stable Diffusion) for both creative and analytical purposes.  
- Conceptualize, design, and construct an original creative machine that reflects their understanding of art and technology.  



### **Course Foundations**

**Media Workshops**:
Practical sessions focus on building technical literacy, like using LLMs, Stable Diffusion, and other tools to explore the interplay of text, image, and audience dynamics.

**Confounding Artworks**:
These sessions foreground media materiality and "trouble" what media do. The featured artworks put computational systems, interfaces, or physical media into the spotlight, forcing us to see how they unlock, restrict, or reshape creativity.

**Debates on Media**:
Structured debates challenge students to critically engage with theoretical positions like Benjamin’s aura or McLuhan’s media determinism, connecting ideas to contemporary contexts.
