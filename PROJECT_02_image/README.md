# Re-illustrating "The Medium is the Massage"

![](imgs/MediumMassage.jpg)

## Project Overview

This project challenges you to critically examine and reimagine McLuhan and Fiore's "The Medium is the Massage" for our contemporary media landscape using AI image generation. You'll identify outdated concepts, problematic representations, and opportunities for modernization while exploring how the medium of AI-generated art itself influences the message.

### Project Objectives
1. Analyze the original work's visual and textual elements through a contemporary lens
2. Identify and address problematic or outdated content
3. Reimagine key concepts using modern media references
4. Create new illustrations using ComfyUI/Stable Diffusion
5. Reflect on how AI as a medium affects the message

### Tools Required
- Original copy of "[The Medium is the Massage](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwyDePyHbx1RMzdjMGUxZjctZTI2MC00NTNiLTg1YWYtY2U2YzNjZjBkODJl/view?pli=1&resourcekey=0-ynv9L2tGhIJO4TxjcWA_YA)"
- ComfyUI with Stable Diffusion (in the lab)
- Documentation template (below)
- Image editing software (optional)
