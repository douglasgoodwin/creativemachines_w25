# Writing Workshop Guide: First Draft Review

## Pre-Workshop Preparation
Bring:
- Original Benjamin chapter
- Your rough draft
- List of examples you're updating
- Notes from previous workshops

## Workshop Structure (3 hours)

### Hour 1: Paragraph Level Review
Work in pairs. For ONE key paragraph:

1. Read Original & Rewrite (5 min each)
- Original paragraph
- Your rewritten version
- Explain your changes

2. Get Feedback (10 min)
Partner checks:
□ Does the core theory remain clear?
□ Do new examples work?
□ Is the style still "Benjamin-like"?
□ What's the strongest change?
□ What needs work?

3. Revise (10 min)
- Make quick improvements
- Note bigger changes needed

### Hour 2: Chapter Level Review
Work in groups of 3-4 with related chapters:

1. Share Chapter Plans (30 min)
Each person presents:
□ Main updates you're making
□ Biggest challenge
□ Where you need help

2. Discussion (30 min)
Group explores:
□ Connections between chapters
□ Shared challenges
□ Possible solutions

### Hour 3: Writing Time
Individual work with consultation available:
- Apply feedback
- Develop weak sections
- Test new examples
- Check theoretical consistency

## Feedback Guide

### For Giving Feedback
Ask these questions:
1. Theory Check
   □ Is Benjamin's core argument clear?
   □ Do new examples support it?
   □ What theoretical elements got lost?

2. Example Check
   □ Are updates meaningful or superficial?
   □ Do they help modern readers?
   □ Are they specific enough?

3. Style Check
   □ Does it maintain academic rigor?
   □ Is the voice consistent?
   □ Are terms clearly defined?

4. Connection Check
   □ How does this fit with your chapter?
   □ What shared themes do you see?
   □ Where could chapters reference each other?

### For Receiving Feedback
Note:
□ Most useful suggestions
□ Biggest concerns raised
□ Resources needed
□ Next steps

## Sample Paragraph Review

ORIGINAL:
"Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be."

REWRITE ATTEMPT:
"Even the highest resolution digital copy of an artwork lacks one crucial element: its embodied presence in physical space and time, its unique existence in a specific location that can be encountered directly."

FEEDBACK NOTES:
+ Maintains theoretical focus on presence
+ "Resolution" updates reproduction
+ Physical/digital contrast works
- Could be more specific about digital context
- Might explore virtual space concept
- Consider adding platform examples

REVISION PLAN:
1. Add specific platform reference
2. Explore virtual/physical contrast
3. Connect to later points about screens

## Common Issues & Solutions

1. Lost Theory in Examples
- Return to analysis worksheet
- Check each example's purpose
- Make theoretical links explicit

2. Inconsistent Voice
- Compare sentence structures
- Note Benjamin's key phrases
- Balance old/new terminology

3. Weak Examples
- Make them more specific
- Add technical details
- Connect to reader experience

4. Disconnected Updates
- Show links to original
- Explain why this example
- Connect to larger changes

## Next Steps Template

1. Revision Priorities
□ Theoretical clarity
□ Example specificity
□ Style consistency
□ Chapter connections

2. Writing Plan
□ Sections to rewrite
□ Examples to develop
□ Terms to define
□ Links to add

3. Resource Needs
□ Research needed
□ Feedback needed
□ Technical help
□ Reference materials

## Workshop Deliverable

Submit a revision plan including:
1. Feedback summary
2. Planned changes
3. Resource needs
4. Timeline to complete

Keep it simple - focus on major improvements rather than perfect prose.

Remember:
- Theory first, examples second
- Specific is better than general
- Connect to other chapters
- Keep Benjamin's voice
- Document your changes
