## Three Core Prompts

1. ANALYSIS PROMPT
```
Read this passage from Benjamin's "Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction":
[paste passage]

Please:
1. Identify the main theoretical argument
2. List the historical examples used
3. Explain what aspects are time-specific vs universal
```

2. MODERNIZATION PROMPT
```
In this passage, Benjamin discusses [brief summary].
[paste passage]

What would be contemporary examples of:
1. The technology he describes
2. The social effects he identifies
3. The cultural changes he notes

For each example, explain how it connects to Benjamin's core argument.
```

3. CRITIQUE PROMPT
```
I want to update this passage for today:
[paste passage]

I'm thinking of using [your example] as a modern parallel.

Please:
1. Identify any ways this example might NOT fit Benjamin's theory
2. Suggest how to address these issues
3. Point out what aspects of the original I should be sure to preserve
```

## Workshop Exercises

### Hour 1: Learning the Prompts
1. Practice with Hill photography section:
   - Run Analysis Prompt
   - Note what the LLM catches/misses
   - Refine prompt based on results

2. Try your own variations:
   - Add specific questions
   - Focus on particular aspects
   - Compare different responses

### Hour 2: Working with Your Chapter
1. Initial Analysis:
   - Run core prompts on your chapter
   - Note useful insights
   - List questions to investigate

2. Example Testing:
   - Propose modern examples
   - Use Critique Prompt to test them
   - Refine based on feedback

### Hour 3: Developing Your Approach
1. Create custom prompts for:
   - Your specific examples
   - Your area of expertise
   - Your writing style

2. Document useful responses:
   - Save helpful analyses
   - Note effective prompt patterns
   - Mark issues to avoid

## Tips for Good Results

1. Give Context
- BETTER: "This is from Benjamin's essay about art reproduction. He's discussing how photography changed art."
- WORSE: "Analyze this passage."

2. Be Specific
- BETTER: "How would Benjamin view TikTok's impact on dance performance?"
- WORSE: "What would Benjamin think about social media?"

3. Test Examples
- BETTER: "Would NFTs really fit Benjamin's concept of aura? Why/why not?"
- WORSE: "Give me modern examples."

4. Guide the Response
- BETTER: "Focus on how digital reproduction differs from mechanical reproduction."
- WORSE: "Update this for today."

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. LLM Misses Context
- Add key background in prompt
- Reference specific Benjamin concepts
- Check if response maintains theoretical framework

2. Examples Don't Quite Fit
- Use Critique Prompt to analyze fit
- Ask about specific aspects of comparison
- Request explanation of limitations

3. Lost Benjamin's Voice
- Share examples of his style
- Ask for analysis of his rhetoric
- Request preservation of key terms

## Deliverable Template

1. Your Best Prompts
   - Analysis prompts that worked
   - Example-testing prompts
   - Style-checking prompts

2. Useful Responses
   - Key insights about your chapter
   - Validated modern examples
   - Potential pitfalls identified

3. Writing Plan
   - How you'll use LLM in writing
   - Where you'll need human review
   - Balance of AI and personal input

## Remember
- LLMs are thought partners, not writers
- Test theoretical fits carefully
- Maintain Benjamin's rigor
- Trust your expertise
- Document your process

## Assessment Criteria
- Prompt effectiveness
- Critical use of responses
- Theoretical consistency
- Documentation quality
