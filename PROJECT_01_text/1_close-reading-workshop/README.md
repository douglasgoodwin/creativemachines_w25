# Style Analysis Workshop

## Concept Analysis Worksheet

1. Core Theory Extraction
   □ What is Benjamin's main theoretical claim in this passage?
   □ What larger argument about art/media is he making?
   □ How would you title this section for a modern reader?

2. Example Analysis
   □ List all technological examples (photography, film, etc.)
   □ List all art/cultural examples (paintings, theater, etc.)
   □ List all social/political references
   □ Mark which examples could be updated vs which are historically essential

3. Conceptual Flow
   □ Number the progression of Benjamin's argument
   □ Draw arrows showing how examples support theory
   □ Note where historical context shapes the argument

4. Knowledge Mapping
   □ Circle terms that need modern definition
   □ Note historical references that need context
   □ Identify concepts that need contemporary parallels

5. Universal Principles
   □ What does this say about how media changes society?
   □ What human experiences with technology are described?
   □ How do these ideas apply to current media?

6. Modern Understanding Check
   □ How would you explain this to a TikTok creator?
   □ What questions would a digital native ask?
   □ How could you test if someone gets the core concept?



## Example Analysis: Hill Section Transformation

### Original Benjamin:

"In Hill's Newhaven fishwife, her eyes cast down in such indolent, seductive modesty, there remains something that goes beyond testimony to the photographer's art, something that cannot be silenced, that fills you with an unruly desire to know what her name was, the woman who was alive there, who even now is still real and will never consent to be wholly absorbed into art."

### Worksheet Analysis:

1. Core Theory:

- Photography captures something that resists artistic transformation
- Real human presence persists in photographs
- Tension between documentation and art

2. Examples:

- Can Update: Specific photograph, fishwife
- Must Keep: Concept of subject resisting artistic absorption

3. Flow:
4. Specific photo description
5. Recognition of artistic element
6. Identification of something beyond art
7. Analysis of photograph's unique power

8. Knowledge Needed:

- Hill's photography practice
- 19th century portrait conventions
- Class/social context of subjects

5. Universal Elements:

- Human presence in images
- Tension between real and artistic
- Desire to know the subject

6. Understanding Check:
   "How do you feel when you find an old Instagram post and wonder about the real person behind it?"

### Plain Style Version:

"When you look at old social media posts, you often want to know more about the real person in the photo. Even professional influencer photos have this effect - there's always something real about the person that doesn't get lost in the staging and filters. You can't help wanting to know who they really are."

### Benjamin-Style Modern Version:

"In the carefully curated Instagram portrait of the young content creator, her gaze intentionally averted in practiced vulnerability, there persists an element that transcends algorithmic optimization and digital artifice. Something obstinately human refuses to be silenced, awakening in the viewer an irrepressible desire to know the name, the reality, of the woman who existed in that digital moment - who, even now, maintains her concrete being and resists complete absorption into the platform's commodified aesthetics."

## Exercise Structure

2. Share in groups of 3 (20 min)
3. Class discussion of key findings (20 min)

### Hour 2: Transformation Practice

1. Write plain version (15 min)
2. Write Benjamin-style version with modern examples (15 min)
3. Share and compare in pairs (15 min)
4. Discuss what worked/didn't work (15 min)

### Hour 3: Chapter Work

1. Initial worksheet analysis of assigned chapter (20 min)
2. Transform one key paragraph (20 min)
3. Share in chapter groups (20 min)

## Sample Chapter Analysis (Chapter 1 Opening)

### Original:

"In principle a work of art has always been reproducible. Man-made artifacts could always be imitated by men. Replicas were made by pupils in practice of their craft, by masters for diffusing their works, and, finally, by third parties in the pursuit of gain."

### Worksheet Analysis:

1. Core Theory:

- Art reproduction is not new
- Different motivations for reproduction exist
- Economic/social factors drive reproduction

2. Examples:

- Can Update: Student copies, master copies, commercial copies
- Must Keep: Principle of reproducibility

3. Flow:
4. General principle stated
5. Historical context given
6. Specific cases listed
7. Motivations explained

### Modern Version:

"Creative work has always been replicable. Digital content can be copied by anyone with access to technology. Remixes are made by fans learning their craft, by creators expanding their reach, and, inevitably, by others seeking to monetize trending content."



## Deliverable Template

1. Chapter Analysis
   - Core theoretical claims (must keep)
   - Historical examples (can update)
   - Key terms needing modern definition

2. Sample Transformations
   - One paragraph in plain style
   - Same paragraph in Benjamin style with modern examples

3. Update Plan
   - Which examples you'll change
   - What personal expertise you'll add
   - How you'll maintain theoretical rigor



## Assessment Focus

- Understanding of Benjamin's core arguments
- Ability to separate theory from examples
- Skill in updating examples while maintaining theoretical integrity
- Balance of personal voice with Benjamin's style
