## UCLA Week 2: Textual analysis

I will try to keep class today as normal as possible, but in reality it's really just a check-in. Let's keep moving forward as best as possible. 

I just created two assignments to practice textual analysis. The basic idea is to select a paragraph from our GitHub repository and perform analysis with a worksheet. The second assignment is to do the same exercise with an LLM such as ChatGPT, Gemini, or ClaudeAI and think about how humans may be better at literary analysis than AIs. The goal is to prepare you for refurbishing a paragraph from "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction."
