**Worksheet: Textual Analysis with AI Assistance**

 

**Text to Analyze:**

(Insert the paragraph or short text passage you want to analyze here)

**Instructions:** **1. Start with a Question:** Begin with a specific question about the text that you want the LLM to help you with. Examples include: * What is the main theme or idea of this text? * What is the tone and purpose of this writing? * What are the key arguments presented in the text? * What is the author’s viewpoint or bias, if any?

**2. Engage the LLM:** * Choose your preferred LLM (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude AI, etc.). * Provide the text to the LLM and your question clearly in the prompt. * Try different prompts. For example: "Analyze this paragraph: [insert paragraph] and identify the main idea and tone." Or you might try, "Summarize the key points in the following text: [insert paragraph]". You may have to be very precise in your requests to get exactly the sort of response that you are seeking.

**3. Record the AI's Output:** * Carefully copy and paste the LLM's response to your analysis prompt into the "LLM Output" section below.

**4. Analyze and Evaluate the LLM's Response:** * **Accuracy:** Is the LLM's analysis accurate? Does it correctly identify the main idea, tone, purpose, etc.? * **Depth:** Does the LLM provide a comprehensive analysis, or does it miss important details? * **Bias:** Does the LLM seem to introduce any bias, or does it neutrally analyze the text? * **Reasoning:** Does the LLM explain *why* it reached the conclusions it did? * **Usefulness:** How useful was the LLM’s analysis in helping *you* to understand the text? * **Originality:** Did the LLM generate novel ideas or interpretations, or does it regurgitate obvious points? * **Limitations:** What are the weaknesses or limitations of the LLM's analysis? * **Human Element:** What unique insights did *you* gain from reading the text that the LLM missed?

- **Modifications:** How would you revise the LLM's analysis to make it more accurate or comprehensive, based on your reading and knowledge of the text?

**5. Reflect and Summarize:**

- How does this exercise change your view on the use of LLMs in textual analysis?
