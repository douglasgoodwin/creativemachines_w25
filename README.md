This course delves into the concept of the "creative machine," which refers to a system, process, or apparatus that fosters creativity. The course will explore how artificial intelligence (AI) enhances such systems. Students will learn to assess how AI influences and reshapes creative practices and critically evaluate canonical works in media theory from a digital perspective. They will also use AI tools for both creative and analytical purposes. The course emphasizes hands-on learning and exploration of cutting-edge AI tools, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Stable Diffusion. Students will engage in media workshops, examine confounding artworks, and participate in debates on media. The course culminates in the design and construction of personalized creative machines that demonstrate a critical engagement with technology, art, and creativity in modern life.

This course evolved from previous courses entitled "Machine Learning for Artists" and "AI for Experimental Animation". It emphasizes understanding the internals of creative AI systems. The instructor, Doug Goodwin, is an active video artist and the Fletcher Jones Scholar of Computation at Scripps.

Students will complete three major projects:

+ Project 1: Refurbishing Walter Benjamin
+ Project 2: Re-Mediating McLuhan
+ Project 3: Building Your Creative Machine

The course takes a critical and analytical approach to understanding generative art, focusing less on production and more on comprehending the internal workings of generative art tools and their historical context. The final project requires students to create a standalone creative machine.
